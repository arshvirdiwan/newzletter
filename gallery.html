        <h2>Latest Flashpoint In Trinamool vs Bengal Governor: Rejected Bills</h2><BR>
         <p><i> The West Bengal government has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging Governor CV Ananda Bose's refusal to give assent to eight bills. The state's counsel, Astha Sharma, urged the court to list the petition for immediate consideration.

According to the state's submission, denying approval to bills without providing grounds undermines democratic governance.</p></i><br>
